If you keep wondering if somebody understands
Darling, I don't understand you
If you stay awake at night waiting for somebody right
Baby, oh, your karma is due

Like, I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time, like who knew? (Like who knew?)
Music we got into
Songs we fell in love to
Boy, this feels so wrong too
(Ah, ah, ah)

If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up
If we ever broke up, I'd call your dad
And tell him all the shittiest of things you've said
If wе ever broke up

Boy, don't gеt emotional
'Cause it's not personal
It's just the way, just the way it goes
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up
(Ha-ah, ha-ah)

You're living in Wonderland
If you think I'll understand
All the shit you put me through
If girls in white dresses and big winter weddings
Is something you want to be true (Yeah)
Then pack up your drama, this selfish dilemma
Is something this shit can't undo

Like, I would never hate you
But only if you want to
So much time like, who knew? Woah

If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
If we ever broke up (Ha-ah, ha-ah, ah)
If we ever broke up, I'd call your dad
And tell him all the shittiest of things you've said
If we ever broke up

Boy, don't get emotional
'Cause it's not personal
It's just the way, just the way it goes
If we ever broke up, I'd never be sad
Thinking about everything that we had
