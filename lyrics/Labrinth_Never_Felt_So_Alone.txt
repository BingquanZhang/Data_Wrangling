Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na

In a whip (Woah), thinkin', "What if (Woah)
You and this (Woah) never existed?"
Hollow kiss (Woah), bottle liquor (Oh)
Man, I'm sick, man, I'm schizo

All white leather
You know this man ain't shit without you in the interior (I'm dyin' somewhere in the dark)
All white leather
And I think, "What if we weren't ridin' and dyin' together?"
The whole world would fall apart

And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na (Never felt so alone, woo! Alone)
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na

I thought you were my new best friend (My)
Wish I knew better then
Who knew you were just out to get me?
My whole world just fell apart

'Cause I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
