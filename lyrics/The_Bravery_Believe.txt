The faces all around me, they don't smile, they just crack
Waiting for our ship to come, but our ship's not coming back
We do our time like pennies in a jar
What are we saving for?
What are we saving for?

There's a smell of stale fear that's reeking from our skins
And the drinking never stops because the drinks absolve our sins
We sit and grow our roots into the floor
But what are we waitin' for?
What are we waitin' for?

So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

Something's always coming, you can hear it in the ground
It swells into the air with the rising, rising sound
And never comes, but shakes the boards and rattles all the doors
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
You might also like[Chorus]
So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

I am hiding from some beast but the beast was always here
Watching without eyes because the beast is just my fear
That I am just nothing, now it's just what I've become
What am I waiting for?
It's already done, oh

So give me something to believe
'Cause I am living just to breathe
And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
So give me something to believe

And I need something more
To keep on breathing for
