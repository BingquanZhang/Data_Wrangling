Only met on the weekend
Said I'm not catchin' feelings
Oh, I guess I lied
Divin' off of the deep end
I can't think of a reason
We should take our time
Ah-ooh

All or nothin'
Let's just trust the night
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Burnin' down the street, no left, right, left, right
I don't wanna see no red light, red light
Fast lane on the beat, go ten, five, ten, five
You right next to me, feel the heat
Goin' overdrive
Goin' overdrive, yeah

Yeah, I know you're a stranger
But I'm likin' the danger
Of the "I don't know"
Don't give a fuck about labels
Throw thе dice on the table
And just let 'em roll
Ah-ooh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All or nothin'
Let's just trust the night
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Burnin' down the street, no left, right, left, right
I don't wanna see no red light, red light
Fast lane on the beat, go ten, five, ten, five
You right next to me, feel the heat
Goin' overdrive
Goin' overdrive, yeah

All or nothin'
Let's just trust the night, night
All or nothin'
You're my ride or die
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Burnin' down the street, no left, right, left, right
I don't wanna see no red light, red light (Red light)
Fast lane on the beat, go ten, five, ten, five (Ten, five)
You right next to me, feel the heat
Goin' overdrive (Oh-oh-oh)
Goin' overdrive, yeah (Ooh)
Goin' overdrive (Overdrive)
