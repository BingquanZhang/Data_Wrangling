I'm fierce, I'm feared
You know I'm the baddest here
Pull up with my crew, boohoo
You'll be wiping up more than a puddle of tears
My competition, call her Urs'
But her curses ain't the worst
I got potions, evil spells to turn your life from bad to worse
Then there's that desperate girl
Comin' for me, tryna mess with my world
Well, villainous is how I live
She'll regret messing with the wrong sea witch, 'cause

I got a lifetime of vengеance, I'm savage to the bonе
And anyone who crosses me gon' wish they were never born
(Hahahahaha)

They won't know what's coming when I hit 'em with that (Revenge)
They gonna start running when I hit 'em with that (Revenge)
Won't stop 'til I conjure up a painful perfect punishment
I don't get mad, I get even
Gon' find the perfect revenge

Gon' find that perfect (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Perfect revenge (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Gon' find that perfect (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Perfect revenge
Gon' find that perfect (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Perfect revenge (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Gon' find that perfect (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Perfect revenge (Ah-ya-ah-ya)

Mm, any suggestions?
Well, why don't you make her walk the plank?
Darling, that's too easy
Prick her with a thousand thorns!
And what? She'd fall asleep?
We could burn her to a crisp
*Yeah, let's burn her to a crisp*
No, it should be worse, worse, worse than all of these

Revenge should be vicious in whatever we do
To that poor unfortunate soul should be ten times more cruel

They won't know what's coming when I hit 'em with that (Revenge)
They gonna start running when I hit 'em with that (Revenge)
Won't stop 'til I conjure up a painful perfect punishment
I don't get mad, I get even
Gon' find a perfect revenge

Calling all spirits of the Black Lagoon
Show me your recipe fit for her doom
Toxically sweet with a side of pure spite
I need the perfect revenge that will bite

What's this? A book, that's it?
I asked for a painful punishment!
But hold up, wait, this might be evil on a plate
So I'ma serve her what she deserves, what she deserves
And that's justice, dressed up like the sweetest dessert
Perfect

They won't know what's coming when I hit 'em with that (Revenge)
They gonna start running when I hit 'em with that (Revenge)
Won't stop 'til I conjure up a painful perfect punishment
I don't get mad, I get even
Gon' find the perfect revenge

Gon' find that perfect (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Perfect revenge (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
Gon' find that perfect (Ah-ya-ah-ya)
