Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away (away, away)
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me, (take on me)
Take me on, (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two (two, take on me)

So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me (take on me)
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me, (take on me)
Take me on, (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two (two)
In a day or two (take on me)

Things that you say
Oh, is it live or just to play my worries away
You're all the things I can't remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me, (take on me)
Take me on, (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
