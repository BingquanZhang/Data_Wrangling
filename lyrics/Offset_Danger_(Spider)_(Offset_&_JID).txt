Life's so dangerous (Dangerous), I was made for this (Hey)
I fight atheists, I'm sayin', I'm sayin' (Uh)
Need my thеrapist, I wasn't prepared for this
I protect thе area, life can get a little scarier (Scary)
Like, the boogeyman comin' (Boogeyman)
I got the boogeyman runnin'
I had the plot, I filled up my conscience (Hey), uh
Swing like a monkey (Swing), through the buildings, I'm comin' (Comin')
Save the day on Sunday, goin' to school on Monday (Hey)
Can't throw in the flag, no, you can't quit on the job (Can't quit the job)
Maybe the bank get robbed (Maybe the)
Turn it up, break the knot (Turn it up)
I gotta turn to a beast (Beast)

(She's webbed)
Look at the city, it's in a blaze (Woah)
Tell all the people to get away
Heard that they let the animals out of the cage (Woah, woah)
If you sit and just listen, you hear the snakes
Send me the mission, I'm on the case
Tell 'em, "Drop me the pin, I'ma penetrate"
Me and danger on a dinner date (Danger)
Oh, let me demonstrate
We need somebody to come back and save it today because nobody feelin' safe
Villain put a mask on his face so it's no identifyin' the assailant
Somethin' major, somethin' more amazin' is on the way, ain't no point in waitin'
Now we gon' see more crazy, real loud bangin', wakin' up babies, um
And we gon' see more dangerous things untanglin', but the MAC swangin'
Now we all speakin' my language, gotta stay strong, press on through the pain, and
Make it back home, back, won't ever change it
Say the name if you know where I'm bangin'
