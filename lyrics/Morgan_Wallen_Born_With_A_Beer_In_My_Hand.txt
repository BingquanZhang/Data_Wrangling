Granddaddy drank Heavy, and daddy drank Light
I can turn any day to Saturday night, if I want to
And most the time I want to
I can still paint a picture of a hemlock view
My mountains had smoke, but the ones that were blue that we'd buy then
Were the ones I spent a little more time in
Between the hangovers and the handcuffs
It’s been a minute since I had one in my hand, 'cause

Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I’m livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriеty
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I’m just sayin’ I'm doin’ thе best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand

When I was puttin' 'em down, they put me through hell
Put some scars on some trucks, myself as well
But if I never did put that can to my mouth
I wouldn't have nothin’ I could sing about
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doin' the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
Ah yeah, I was born with a beer in my hand

Woah, I ain't the devil that I acted like years ago
No, but I'll be back one day, y'all, even though

Everybody says it's gonna be the death of me
But these days I'm livin' on the side of alive
Just 'cause I smile through my sobriety
Don't mean it ain't chillin' in the back of my mind
I ain't sayin' I swore it off for good
I'm just sayin' I'm doin' the best I can
But what do you expect from a redneck?
Hell, I was born with a beer in my hand
Ah yeah, I was born with a beer in my hand
