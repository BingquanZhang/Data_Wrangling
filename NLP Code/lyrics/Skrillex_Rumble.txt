Hear the rumble
Hear the rumble, yeah, yeah

Run for dem life when I step into the jungle
Said they wanna group up, they better move up
Never gonna win a Royal Rumble
And when I come through, you know what I love do
I send shots for your team and leader
I make a witness decide to vacate
The war's gettin' sweet just like a Ribena

Yo, listen, you hear that?
Killеrs in the jungle
Killers in thе jungle
Killers in the jungle
Yo, listen, you hear that?
Killers in the jungle
Killers in the jungle
Killers in the jungle
