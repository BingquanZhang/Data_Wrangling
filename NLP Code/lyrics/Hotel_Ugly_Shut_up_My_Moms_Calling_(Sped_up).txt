I just want to rewind, I haven't seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through, I can tell that it isn’t you
So baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately, you've been acting like you hardly know me

Baby, come home, home
So baby, won’t you say somethin'?
Baby, come home, home
So baby, won't you say somethin'?
Baby, come home, home
So baby, won't you say somethin'?
Baby, come home, home
So baby, won't you say somethin'?

I just want to rewind, I haven’t seen you in a long time
You got me feeling so lonely
Even when you come through, I can tell that it isn’t you
So baby, bring it in closely
Hate the way I love you but you're so sweet
I always find a way to say the wrong things
I wish that we were laying in the same sheets
But lately, you’ve been acting like you hardly know me

I've only recently began to fall
I feel the need to go and waste it all
I tried to numb away the pain
I hope someone is watching me, watching me, watching me

Baby, come home, home
So baby, won't you say somethin'?
Baby, come home, home
So baby, won’t you say somethin'?
Baby, come home, home
So baby, won't you say somethin'?
Baby, come home, home
