I took my drugs and took my lovin' when I left out the spot
I left the party with a Barbie, marking X on the dot
She calls my phone up, but I told her, "I'm a loner" (Uh)
But she likes my watch and my droptop and my persona (Uh)
We hit the highway, one-five-five with my whole foot on the dash
She's in my ear, she's got no fear, she could care less if we crash

But on my radar, I've got some nerve to play hard
I waited for my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car, goin' ninety in the rain
Shе took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dancе is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
Pretty baby, ooh

Uh
Face in the daylight, wastin' time on the stars in the sky
She's got my pager, blankets of love fall on my eyes
Then I'm reminded, love don't come 'til you find it
I just hope that it's workin', I'm yearnin', I'm searchin', uh
The afterparty was on Wilson and 73rd
You got the notion that somebody else was with me first

But on my radar, you had some nerve to play hard
You took away my chance, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance

I lost my heart (Uh)
Speedin' car goin' ninety in the rain
She took my heart, filled it with nothin' but pain
This beat in my dance is not for romance
I wanna stay, but playboys, we don't dance, dance, dance (I)

So I won't dance again (I), oh, baby
No, I won't dance again (That's why), oh yeah (Uh)
No, I won't dance again (I)
No, I won't dance again
