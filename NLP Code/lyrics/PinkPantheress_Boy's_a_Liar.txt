Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee because
You only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Thе, the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doеsn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy

Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough

Baby, please, I just want to look nice for you
Come stay with me
Oh, you're not around, so what should I do?
I thought you liked the look about a girl just like me
Baby, please, I know you want to change me
Can you take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

The, the boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy
The boy's a liar, the boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya, you're not looking at me, boy

Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough, good eno-o-ough
